### Minute 0

[00:00] what's up Engineers welcome back Indy
[00:02] Deb danan here welcome to a special
[00:04] video we're walking through my
[00:07] 2025 generative AI predictions we're
[00:10] going to cover my bets on AI coding
[00:12] large language models and generative AI
[00:15] companies throughout 2025 I'm going to
[00:18] share my secret as to how I stay ahead
[00:20] of the curve in the age of generative AI
[00:24] so that you can understand how you can
[00:26] get ahead of the curve as well here's
[00:28] the outline for this video here's what
[00:29] we're going to cover I want to talk
[00:30] about why it's important to make
[00:32] predictions and make bets I do this
[00:34] every single year and this process is
[00:36] critical for My Success back to back
[00:39] year after year after year we're going
[00:41] to then Dive Right In to my 2025 AI
[00:44] predictions we're then going to discuss
[00:46] everything that's happened with
[00:48] principled AI coding huge shout out to
[00:51] everyone that has taken principled AI
[00:53] coding that is learning that is growing
[00:55] and accelerating their engineering with
[00:57] AI coding and then we're going to

### Minute 1

[01:00] quickly review my 2024 performance as
[01:03] you can see we have a win rate of 87% it
[01:06] was a crazy accurate year I made 41 bets
[01:10] and I got 36 correct and then lastly
[01:12] we're going to talk about how we can
[01:14] take these bets take our predictions
[01:16] turn them into actions which you can
[01:19] then get concrete results right what's
[01:21] the point if there's no return on
[01:23] investment on your predictions on your
[01:25] bets and on your actions so if these
[01:28] topics interest you stick around and and
[01:30] let's Dive Right
[01:33] In with all new technology the most
[01:37] important Advantage is time information
[01:40] and access you want to be the first to
[01:43] know about new technologies for the
[01:45] longest period of time with the best
[01:48] access to them right information time
[01:51] and access so why is this this is
[01:53] because by being there early by
[01:56] understanding the technology and by
[01:57] having access to it you obtain outsize

### Minute 2

[02:01] return on your time and energy before
[02:04] anyone else even gets the chance to
[02:06] imagine having access to 03 right now
[02:09] think of all the incredible things you
[02:11] could do with that technology so then
[02:13] the next natural question arises right
[02:16] what's the best way to position yourself
[02:18] to know about new technology early and
[02:21] have the best access to the technology
[02:23] so we're just thinking through this
[02:24] process step by step okay so we have
[02:28] four options and we just going to walk
[02:30] through these one by one you can follow
[02:33] the crowd this is very clearly and very
[02:35] obviously the slowest way to position
[02:38] yourself to know about new tech early
[02:40] and have access okay if you're just
[02:42] following what everyone else is doing
[02:44] you are showing up very likely in the
[02:46] back of the pack right with the masses
[02:49] we can do much better we have three
[02:51] other options you can follow bleeding
[02:54] edge researchers Engineers Builders and
[02:56] companies okay this is much faster right

### Minute 3

[03:00] when you're following the engineers that
[03:02] are putting out the Next Generation
[03:04] language model technology AI coding
[03:06] tools coding patterns repositories and
[03:09] generally information you're going to
[03:11] have Fast Access okay but we can do even
[03:16] better what's faster than following the
[03:19] people releasing the new tools the new
[03:21] ideas the new technology the new models
[03:24] you can quite literally be the bleeding
[03:27] edge researcher engineer Builder company
[03:30] okay this gives you instantaneous access
[03:34] to know about the new tech early and
[03:37] have the best access okay so I hope you
[03:40] can see where this is going right why do
[03:42] we make predictions why do we make bets
[03:44] we have one additional option here and
[03:46] that is of course you can predict what
[03:49] will come and bet on it with your time
[03:52] money and energy before it happens right
[03:56] this is beyond instantaneous there is no
[03:59] faster way to be in a position to win

### Minute 4

[04:03] with a new technology than before it
[04:05] even exists okay and this is why it's
[04:08] important to plan to predict and then
[04:11] put your money time and energy behind
[04:13] your predictions right that's what
[04:15] changes the prediction into a bet when
[04:17] you have some skin in the game this is
[04:19] why it's so important to make
[04:20] predictions this is why every single
[04:22] year on the channel I share my
[04:24] predictions for the year here with you
[04:27] because when you make predictions and
[04:29] bet on them you gain the earliest access
[04:31] for the longest period of time to the
[04:34] new technology information and
[04:35] opportunities before they even exist
[04:38] right before the bleeding edge
[04:40] researcher engineer or Builder has even
[04:42] created the thing so what is a concrete
[04:45] example of turning a prediction into a
[04:47] bet and then acting on it imagine you
[04:49] predict that in 2025 we're going to see
[04:52] a new wave of language models that can
[04:55] support 2 to 5 million input tokens
[04:59] before before that even happens right

### Minute 5

[05:01] before the bleeding edge researcher
[05:03] releases it before everyone that follows
[05:05] them sees it and before the crowd sees
[05:08] it you are choosing option four you're
[05:10] predicting that this will happen and
[05:12] you're betting on it by taking the time
[05:14] and the resources and your energy and
[05:17] you're building out this new context
[05:19] management system or a personal
[05:21] knowledge base where you can quickly
[05:23] build context relate context tag context
[05:26] and build up a graph of information for
[05:29] your code bces uh projects documentation
[05:32] and large token sets that you can then
[05:35] combine into you know very large
[05:38] multi-million input token prompts right
[05:42] and you can do all this before it's even
[05:46] released okay so this is a concrete
[05:48] example of why it's important to make
[05:50] predictions and make bets this is how I
[05:53] stay ahead of the curve don't wait for
[05:55] things to be created make a bet assume
[05:58] it will be created and and if you're
[05:59] wrong pivot and if you're right you're

### Minute 6

[06:02] there before anyone else okay let's move
[06:04] on so couple prediction disclaimers and
[06:06] then let's talk about the themes for the
[06:07] predictions just to get this out of the
[06:09] way these predictions and bets are my
[06:11] own be skeptical form your own opinions
[06:13] don't blindly follow me or anyone
[06:15] without first forming your own opinions
[06:18] okay any prediction against or for a
[06:20] company is not a slight against them um
[06:23] it's just a prediction so I'm not here
[06:25] to you know bad mouth any company or llm
[06:27] or tool these are just predictions okay
[06:31] and then lastly I'm not sponsored by any
[06:33] company I'm not promoting anyone's
[06:35] products or language models I'm not paid
[06:38] to make any of these predictions okay
[06:39] I'm a free agent third party one of the
[06:43] reasons why I want to stay this way is
[06:44] so that you can trust me throughout
[06:46] every single video that I put out and
[06:48] you can know that the only thing I'm
[06:50] selling is something that I am building
[06:53] for you we're going to talk about
[06:54] principal AI coding a little bit more
[06:56] further on in this video okay so let's
[06:59] talk about them so what are the themes

### Minute 7

[07:00] for my predictions we're going to be
[07:01] talking about AI coding large Lage model
[07:04] plus so you know AI agents personal AI
[07:07] assistants AG gentics geni companies and
[07:10] and a couple predictions kind of mixed
[07:12] in on the engineering job market okay
[07:14] this year I'm dialing in on fewer higher
[07:17] conviction predictions for 2025 we have
[07:20] a total of just 15 predictions down from
[07:24] I think I made 46 last year um I'm
[07:26] really dialing in I'm specializing I
[07:28] want to make higher conviction bets and
[07:30] actions against my predictions so just
[07:33] 15 predictions this year let's dive
[07:36] in starting with kind of a hot spicy
[07:39] take here if you've been AI coding you
[07:41] probably don't think this is a spicy
[07:42] take but AI coding becomes the standard
[07:46] so this is how this is going to work I
[07:47] have a kind of headline I have a
[07:50] prediction and then I have a win
[07:52] condition and a conviction level if
[07:54] you're not using a to code you're not
[07:56] coding and you're not getting hired so
[07:58] here's the wind condition I'm adding the

### Minute 8

[08:00] wind condition this year to make it a
[08:02] lot clearer for the end of the year
[08:04] whether I got the prediction right or
[08:06] not so this year in order for this
[08:08] prediction to be right for 2025 we need
[08:10] to see a clear sentiment shift in
[08:12] engineering media from you know writing
[08:14] code with AI is unreliable unsafe so on
[08:17] and so forth you've already heard all
[08:18] this crap to you can't keep up with the
[08:21] pace of development without AI this is
[08:24] going to be the shift we're going to see
[08:26] and I have high conviction here so
[08:29] conviction levels low medium high I'm
[08:31] betting big when my conviction is high
[08:33] here AI coding becomes a new standard
[08:35] this is part of the reason I put out
[08:36] principal AI coding more on that later
[08:39] all right so what's next agentic coding
[08:41] begins AI software Engineers become
[08:44] usable thanks to top tier reasoning
[08:46] models improved tool calling performance
[08:48] and more intelligence per input token
[08:52] and the win condition here is that you
[08:53] know Engineers that are on the edge
[08:56] start using agentic coding tools for
[08:59] simp simple tasks I'm not saying it's

### Minute 9

[09:01] going to take over I'm not saying it's
[09:02] going to dominate the industry if you
[09:04] progress to the end of principled AI
[09:06] coding you know that this is possible
[09:08] you know that you can build agentic
[09:10] coding patterns like this to solve you
[09:12] know small to medium difficulty tasks so
[09:15] the wind condition here is that we see a
[09:16] cheaper highquality Devon likee tool
[09:19] come out that takes the Gen AI ecosystem
[09:22] by storm and once again everyone's going
[09:24] to freak out AI is taking Engineers jobs
[09:27] uh that won't be true you and I both
[09:29] know AI doesn't take jobs Engineers
[09:32] using AI take jobs here's kind of a
[09:35] simple AI autonomy graph that I built
[09:37] out about halfway through the year I'll
[09:40] link that video in the description if
[09:41] you want to dive in to that a little bit
[09:42] more but tier one we had co-pilots tier
[09:45] two we have ai coding assistants
[09:47] everyone is using these right now they
[09:48] they've essentially become the standard
[09:50] right think about cursor AER wind Surfer
[09:53] all these applications are kind of just
[09:54] all these tier 2s and then we started to
[09:57] see tier 3s in 2024 they were all really

### Minute 10

[10:00] bad let's be real even Devon the best of
[10:03] them was very very limited but I'm
[10:06] predicting in 20125 a gentic coding
[10:09] begins all right let's move on so
[10:11] Evergreen AI coding experience we're
[10:13] going to see a nonv code based non-
[10:16] agentic Bottoms Up Evergreen reinvented
[10:19] application for AI coding so this is
[10:22] going to be a completely new way to
[10:23] write code with AI beyond the typical
[10:26] chat window uh command control K
[10:28] experiences okay pretty much every tool
[10:31] I have listed here is more or less uh
[10:34] the same thing wither being a special
[10:37] exception here these tools share a lot
[10:39] of the same experiences right uh chat
[10:41] window codebase lookup command K
[10:44] selection prompts uh multifile editing
[10:46] I'm really looking forward to and I'm
[10:48] predicting a brand new revolutionary AI
[10:51] coding tool that really changes how
[10:54] developers interact with AI for coding
[10:56] and to be clear I think it's going to be
[10:58] an AI code tool not an agentic coding

### Minute 11

[11:01] tool so it's not going to be a Devon
[11:03] right I'm not talking about an endtoend
[11:04] solution I think we're going to see
[11:06] something brand new pop up with new
[11:08] pattern new UI new ux and I think it's
[11:10] going to be a really fantastic Evergreen
[11:12] AI coding experience it's going to force
[11:14] us to rethink not in just engineering
[11:16] but cross domains how we can really use
[11:18] language models I have medium conviction
[11:20] here this is kind of a riskier one but I
[11:22] am Bing on this happening in 2025 the
[11:25] cost of code declines not experience so
[11:29] I have high conviction here and I
[11:32] imagine you can kind of already see
[11:33] where this is going right the cost of
[11:34] code continues to decline while AI
[11:37] coding becomes the standard right and
[11:39] then eventually agentic coding the cost
[11:41] of expertise experience great judgment
[11:43] and great engineering will continue to
[11:44] rise I do think that unfortunately we're
[11:47] going to continue to see the bottom of
[11:49] the job market kind of continue to fall
[11:51] out right it's going to be harder for
[11:53] junior and mid and Noob Engineers to
[11:56] find their kind of first gig and get
[11:57] that initial experience so so this puts
[11:59] even more pressure on people that can do

### Minute 12

[12:02] the hard work get the real experience
[12:05] and you know people that already have it
[12:06] if you're mid senior plus and you
[12:08] already have the experience you can now
[12:10] multiply it with AI coding tools and
[12:12] this is a big theme that I I reiterate
[12:14] several times in principled AI coding
[12:17] it's not that you can't get great
[12:18] engineering experience as a noob you
[12:20] absolutely can but senior plus Engineers
[12:23] are uniquely positioned to utilize
[12:25] generative AI as long as they are
[12:27] willing to learn new tricks
[12:29] and change the way they think about
[12:32] engineering you want to be thinking more
[12:33] about what you want done and less how
[12:36] it's done hard win condition here Tech
[12:39] job opportunities is going to show clear
[12:41] signals that coding is not really the
[12:43] key part of the job because the cost of
[12:45] code is going to zero it's really going
[12:46] to be about the specialized expertise
[12:49] experience judgment and then the kind of
[12:51] raw engineering skills right
[12:53] architecture modeling documentation
[12:56] that's going to be the key part of jobs
[12:58] and job descriptions okay not the coding

### Minute 13

[13:00] so let's move on to our language model
[13:03] predictions so I'm really excited about
[13:05] these I have firmly believed as soon as
[13:07] I started seeing these articles pop up
[13:09] that AI is hit a wall there's no more
[13:11] data my immediate thought was you are
[13:14] vastly underestimating the explosive
[13:17] potential of not just the tools but the
[13:20] researchers and Builders behind
[13:22] generative AI there's probably like a
[13:25] 100 or 200 Engineers absolutely cracked
[13:28] engineers at these companies that are
[13:31] essentially Paving the future of the
[13:34] tech industry as a whole and I think
[13:36] people just really don't think about
[13:38] that like these guys started popping off
[13:40] back in the 2010s and they haven't
[13:42] stopped and they're not going to stop
[13:44] you know just a reminder like you might
[13:46] see a logo but what's really Behind
[13:49] These great teams are key leaders and
[13:51] then cracked researchers and Engineers
[13:54] grinding because they love to do it okay
[13:57] there is no wall okay never has

### Minute 14

[14:00] been uh I have high conviction here
[14:03] language models will continue to improve
[14:05] across all benchmarks they're going to
[14:08] completely saturate various benchmarks
[14:10] we're starting to see glimpses of this
[14:11] with 03 there is no wall there never was
[14:14] the wi condition here is simple we're
[14:16] going to see three new state-of-the-art
[14:18] base models in 2025 and we're going to
[14:21] see a reasoning model it's going to hit
[14:23] 100% on a popular Benchmark okay I have
[14:26] high conviction here there is no wall
[14:28] there is more data they synthetic data
[14:30] and there are just entire different
[14:32] architectures paradigms and ways to
[14:35] build out language models to completely
[14:37] circumvent any pre-existing notion of a
[14:41] wall I don't buy it never have this is
[14:43] something I'm really excited about we're
[14:45] going to see hyp specialized large
[14:47] language models in 2025 what do I mean
[14:50] by this I think we're going to see small
[14:51] single purposed and not even small it
[14:53] doesn't have to be small but we're going
[14:54] to see single purpose large language
[14:57] models emerge as AI agents as a service

### Minute 15

[15:00] deep seek version 3 is a great example
[15:03] of this right this is a high- performing
[15:05] AI coding specific llm I think we're
[15:09] going to see this trend continue we're
[15:11] going to see entire products built
[15:13] around single use case language models
[15:16] and AI agents and the term AI agents
[15:18] here is a bit more fitting because this
[15:20] does not need to just be a language
[15:22] model API call but it does need to be a
[15:25] specialized tool that you know ends up
[15:27] calling a language model at some point
[15:29] the win condition here I think we're
[15:30] going to see a launch of a successful
[15:31] product built around a single open AI
[15:33] compatible endpoint running a
[15:35] specialized AI agent for a specific use
[15:38] case I'm really excited about this I
[15:40] think this is a very powerful idea I do
[15:42] get the sense that there are a couple
[15:44] you know small companies and maybe even
[15:46] big companies starting to chase this
[15:47] idea um but we really need to see them
[15:49] kind of dig in in order for this to to
[15:51] Really Happen we're going to be covering
[15:52] deep seek V3 in upcoming videos Sub
[15:56] comment like stay tuned for that so
[15:58] what's next so I predict we're going to
[15:59] see the year of infinite memory and not

### Minute 16

[16:02] exactly infinite but it's going to feel
[16:03] infinite we're going to see context
[16:05] Windows expand dramatically to 1 to 5
[16:08] million tokens inside of powerful base
[16:11] models the win condition is simple we're
[16:13] going to see a 5 million token context
[16:15] window base model I have medium
[16:17] conviction here we already know that uh
[16:19] Google is pretty close to this so I use
[16:22] this as an example of something you can
[16:23] concretely prepare for ahead of time to
[16:26] really maximize the value you can get
[16:28] out of this I will say though I do not
[16:30] think most Engineers most product
[16:33] Builders are utilizing the existing
[16:35] context window this is why my conviction
[16:37] is medium here I I really don't see as
[16:40] many people really using the full
[16:42] potential of the Contex window as it
[16:44] really could be myself included only
[16:46] recently have I hit the 500k input token
[16:50] mark for a real kind of you know
[16:51] valuable use case I think we're still
[16:53] going to see this I think that you know
[16:55] engineers and Builders pushing the input
[16:57] token window do want to see a larger

### Minute 17

[17:00] context window all right so next
[17:02] prediction I think we're going to see a
[17:03] GPT 40 level slm what's an slm small
[17:06] language model we saw 54 come out a
[17:09] couple weeks ago still waiting for the
[17:11] official official release from Microsoft
[17:14] this has been really really incredible I
[17:15] got my hands on a version of this this
[17:17] model is insane and it is very very tiny
[17:21] so the prediction here is simple we're
[17:22] going to have GPT 40 LEL small language
[17:25] models on device the win condition here
[17:28] is that we're going to see this embedded
[17:30] inside of the operating system
[17:32] undetectable without benchmarking you
[17:34] know to be super super clear here I mean
[17:37] consumer Hardware truly consumer
[17:40] Hardware not developer Hardware I think
[17:42] we're going to see this you know on
[17:43] truly consumer facing devices we are
[17:46] seeing early signs of this Mac OS
[17:48] devices are going to have a you know on
[17:50] device language model new windows
[17:52] devices are getting this I think this is
[17:54] going to be a continued Trend I'm very
[17:55] confident we're going to see DPT 40
[17:57] level small language model models so

### Minute 18

[18:00] this is an easy prediction to make but I
[18:02] think the amount of it that we're going
[18:03] to see is not truly understood we're
[18:05] going to see exponential slop gener of
[18:08] AI unleashes infinite content
[18:10] repurposing and generation and it's
[18:12] going to flood the internet okay it's
[18:14] going to make it really hard to identify
[18:16] valuable signals and legitimate
[18:18] information from text to images to video
[18:21] we're going to see exponential slop on
[18:24] the internet and so I think as a win
[18:26] condition here we're going to see big
[18:27] platforms put up more content detectors
[18:30] so more AI content detectors but also
[18:33] require new flagging of AI generated
[18:35] content on social platforms High
[18:37] conviction here I don't think this is a
[18:39] difficult prediction to make but
[18:41] concretely making this prediction puts
[18:43] me in a place puts myself and puts you
[18:45] in a place to really think about how to
[18:48] keep track of valuable information
[18:50] sources and valuable information
[18:52] platforms that are rich in actionable
[18:55] information not just hype arousal and
[18:59] you know clickbait you don't want those

### Minute 19

[19:01] you do want actionable information okay
[19:04] so we're going to see exponential slop
[19:06] so let's turn our attention to
[19:08] generative AI companies I'm making this
[19:10] buold claim here I made this prediction
[19:12] last year I was right no one caught up
[19:15] everyone thinks everyone caught up but
[19:17] then we saw 01 we saw 01 Pro and now
[19:20] we've seen 03 open AI is going to remain
[19:24] number one they're going to remain the
[19:26] top llm player with the best class most
[19:29] intelligent model Google is heating up
[19:33] anthropic is competitive right Cloud 3.5
[19:35] Sonet is a top tier model and llama is
[19:38] quite literally killing the market by
[19:40] putting out you know free open source
[19:42] models llama 4 is right around the
[19:44] corner as we know but in the C there is
[19:46] only one king and it is open AI they're
[19:50] going to maintain their lead I do think
[19:52] everyone is continuously underestimating
[19:55] how far ahead they are how big their
[19:59] lead is even with all the exits some of

### Minute 20

[20:01] the researchers leaving some of the key
[20:03] leaders leaving I do not think that they
[20:06] have lost their lead they're going to
[20:07] need to make a massive blunder and I
[20:09] don't see a 12-day back-to-back release
[20:12] ending in the release of a Next
[20:15] Generation Benchmark saturating
[20:17] reasoning model a mistake okay I just
[20:19] don't see them on the course of making a
[20:21] mistake open AI remains number one that
[20:24] doesn't mean Google and anthropic aren't
[20:26] producing high value important you know
[20:29] useful models same with metas I just
[20:32] don't see them taking the throne from
[20:33] open AI in 2025 here's what we're going
[20:35] to see three independent benchmarks
[20:37] showing an open a model at the top
[20:40] across 75% of the benchmarks okay so
[20:43] that's how we're going to denote them
[20:44] being the best I have high conviction
[20:46] here open AI is in the lead and they
[20:48] remain in the lead big Tech shrinks smbs
[20:51] grow this is not just any smv though so
[20:53] this is small to medium AI powered
[20:56] businesses Okay so so big tech companies
[20:59] continue to reduce their Workforce just

### Minute 21

[21:02] to be super clear reduce their Workforce
[21:04] not their influence not their
[21:06] capabilities not their market cap okay
[21:08] they will continue to grow these big
[21:09] tech companies especially these you know
[21:11] gen tech companies they are awake they
[21:14] are driving fast they are making plays
[21:18] Google is the biggest example of that
[21:20] the sleeping giant has awoken at the
[21:22] same time though we're going to see
[21:23] small businesses grow and grow and grow
[21:26] thanks to the productivity of AI tools
[21:28] so the win condition here is simple
[21:29] we're going to see three big tech
[21:31] companies decrease Workforce by 10% in
[21:33] 2025 and we're going to see three small
[21:35] businesses with fewer than 50 employees
[21:38] reach $50 million in valuation okay so
[21:41] medium conviction here feeling pretty
[21:42] good about this one but also not putting
[21:44] too many coins in this there not a lot
[21:46] of actionable information here uh to
[21:48] actually act on data greater than ux
[21:51] greater than LM bench greater than
[21:53] everything else what is this prediction
[21:55] what do I mean by this so a business's
[21:58] most valuable asset become their data

### Minute 22

[22:00] user experience and specialized llm
[22:03] benchmarks this is happening while AI
[22:06] tools basically fully commoditize every
[22:09] other piece of the business okay
[22:11] replicating a business has now become
[22:13] easier and cheaper than ever and this
[22:15] ties fully back into the fact that the
[22:17] cost of code is going to zero okay so
[22:20] what's the win condition here we're
[22:21] going to see a trend emerge where
[22:23] successful AI powered businesses that
[22:26] prioritize capturing data building
[22:29] usable knowledge bases optimizing their
[22:32] ux and then very importantly optimizing
[22:34] their performance with their LMS via
[22:37] benchmarks they are going to win okay so
[22:40] this is kind of a harder win condition
[22:41] I'm not exactly sure I'm going to
[22:43] measure this but but you get the general
[22:44] idea here right data is the most
[22:46] important thing then it's the user
[22:48] experience right solving your domain
[22:50] specific problem really well for your
[22:52] users and then your llm benchmarks all
[22:54] right so one of my last predictions here
[22:56] we're going to see new industry break
[22:58] breing architecture I think we're going

### Minute 23

[23:00] to see something new much like the test
[23:03] time compute the architecture
[23:04] underpinning the powerful reason models
[23:07] I think we're going to see something
[23:08] incredible like that built out by one of
[23:11] the big three gen companies so open Ai
[23:14] and Tropic or Google this is going to be
[23:16] a new model architecture it's going to
[23:18] completely change the type of models
[23:20] that can be built um I do kind of see
[23:22] this trend toward extreme compression
[23:24] right everyone knows about quantization
[23:26] I think it might be related to that so
[23:28] that we can get cost and size down and
[23:30] make the compute Hardware more usable
[23:33] from a high level we're going to see a
[23:35] new architecture I'm keeping my eye out
[23:37] for this I'm looking at research papers
[23:39] trying to just kind of stay ahead here
[23:41] for a groundbreaking architecture so uh
[23:45] wi condition here one of the big three
[23:46] gench companies puts out something that
[23:49] significantly improves model performance
[23:51] without increasing parameter count
[23:52] that's super super key this is one of my
[23:55] only low predictions here uh open AI or
[23:58] topic they're going to release a small

### Minute 24

[24:00] language model it's going to be on
[24:01] device it's going to be highly
[24:02] performant and it's going to you know
[24:04] have the performance of a previous
[24:05] generation 2024 large language model
[24:09] we're going to see a scill gap
[24:10] earthquake I've kind of hinted at this
[24:12] before but we're going to continue to
[24:14] see the bottom of the job market Fallout
[24:16] that means Juniors entry level even some
[24:19] mid levels it's going to be hard for
[24:21] entry level and Junior Engineers product
[24:23] Builders designers to find work at the
[24:27] same time going to see the top of the
[24:29] market rise to absurd Heights and I do
[24:32] want to kind of open this up a little
[24:33] bit and just say more generally those
[24:35] using generative AI effectively will
[24:38] experience exponential Returns on their
[24:40] time while those that are not are going
[24:42] to fall behind like very very very
[24:45] rapidly the wind condition here is very
[24:47] simple we're going to see clear job
[24:48] market signals showing a decline in
[24:50] entry level positions while senior plus
[24:52] and gen AI Specialists opportunities are
[24:54] going to reach New Heights okay so
[24:57] that's 15 predictions for 2025 we'll

### Minute 25

[25:01] review at the end of next year in
[25:04] December around the same time as this
[25:07] video so first off you know what is this
[25:10] principal AI coding is my take on the
[25:12] best way to learn AI coding and the
[25:16] whole idea here is to learn principles
[25:19] of AI coding to build foundational
[25:21] skills that allow you to excel with the
[25:23] a coding tools of today and tomorrow
[25:26] it's been 1 week since principal coding
[25:28] has launched it's been really really
[25:31] incredible I want to start out by saying
[25:33] just a massive massive thank you to
[25:35] everyone who has used learned and is
[25:38] growing their AI engineering tool belt
[25:41] by working through principal AI coding
[25:44] that's what this is okay so this is the
[25:46] best way to learn foundational AI coding
[25:48] here are some of the launch stats uh we
[25:50] have over 300 Engineers mastering the AI
[25:52] coding of today and tomorrow more than
[25:54] 30 positive reviews it's been up for 6
[25:58] days I placed the launch at the end of

### Minute 26

[26:01] the video you know I just want to shout
[26:03] out everyone who has you know trusted me
[26:05] and dove into principal a coding I put a
[26:08] ton of Blood Sweat and prompts into
[26:11] creating this and of course I could not
[26:14] have created it if I wasn't on the
[26:16] ground writing code with AI since it was
[26:19] first possible I've been here since the
[26:21] beginning you can go back on the channel
[26:24] and literally watch my development over
[26:26] the course of you know two plus years
[26:29] now what I've put in this course is the
[26:31] oil of what you need to be successful
[26:34] with AI coding and of course huge thanks
[26:36] to everyone who's provided feedback
[26:38] there is going to be a price increase on
[26:40] January 2nd so if you're eyeing this if
[26:42] you're thinking about getting in just go
[26:44] ahead hop in there's a full refund
[26:47] guarantee before you start the fourth
[26:49] lesson and just to quickly kind of go
[26:51] through in a little bit more detail I
[26:53] built this based on a simple premise
[26:56] software engineering has changed it's
[26:58] time to change with it and we can just

### Minute 27

[27:00] scroll down here AI coding is the new
[27:02] standard just like we were talking about
[27:03] today just like in my predictions right
[27:05] I'm making these predictions for a
[27:06] reason and I am literally betting on it
[27:08] with my time money and energy I built it
[27:11] to help you avoid deprecating yourself
[27:14] in 2025 I do see 2024 being the last
[27:18] year where you can be relevant coding as
[27:20] an engineer without AI after 2025 it's
[27:24] all downhill so I built this course to
[27:26] help you fast track this trans I so that
[27:29] you can WR code with AI and be ready for
[27:31] the next wave which I think we're going
[27:33] to start seeing hint of hence my agentic
[27:36] coding prediction okay in the course we
[27:38] focus on principles not tools everyone
[27:41] wants to always hype up the latest tool
[27:43] yesterday it was cursor today it's wind
[27:45] Surfer tomorrow it'll be something else
[27:47] same thing with models right Gemini 2.0
[27:50] flash Gemini 2 experimental thinking 03
[27:54] anthropic in this course you learn to
[27:56] endure change with principle this is a
[27:59] principle focused AI coding course that

### Minute 28

[28:02] focuses on principles not tools we talk
[28:05] about the big three over and over and
[28:07] over this is a foundational mental model
[28:10] for generative AI but more specifically
[28:13] for AI coding if you've already dove
[28:15] into principal a coding and you've
[28:17] completed the lessons you know exactly
[28:19] what I'm talking about you are already
[28:21] ahead of the curve there are eight
[28:23] lessons grouped into three sections
[28:25] beginner intermediate Advanced where we
[28:27] walk through BAS basic setup multifile
[28:29] editing crafting great prompts we talk
[28:31] about how not to suck we talk about
[28:33] scaling up your capabilities we talk
[28:35] about AER secret and then we talk about
[28:37] agentic loops we talk about pushing the
[28:40] edge of AI coding into again like the
[28:43] prediction I just made into a gentic
[28:45] coating and then we close it off with
[28:47] some principled AI cating like I
[28:49] mentioned the price is going to go up by
[28:51] the time you see this it might be up
[28:53] it's still going to be at a great deal
[28:54] but it is going up you know let's hop
[28:56] back over to this this is here if if you
[28:58] want it I'm not going to keep promoting
[28:59] this and sharing it every single week um

### Minute 29

[29:02] I just want to pitch this one more time
[29:04] here I'll bring it up when it's relevant
[29:06] to the channel on certain AI coding
[29:08] videos when we talk about specific you
[29:10] know topics where it's relevant
[29:12] otherwise this is just going to be here
[29:14] link is going to be in the description
[29:15] for you if you're interested these
[29:17] numbers are going to continue to go up
[29:19] as the channel grows and you know as ad
[29:21] coding becomes even more relevant so why
[29:23] not jump in early join over 300
[29:26] Engineers that are getting a massive of
[29:28] edge in AI coding by learning principle
[29:31] based AI coding that will help you stay
[29:33] relevant not with just today's tools and
[29:35] models but tomorrow's and next year's as
[29:38] well so that's enough on principal AI
[29:40] coding there have been a couple truly
[29:42] just touching reviews that I've received
[29:45] with Engineers reaching out to me
[29:47] telling me that the content that I've
[29:49] shared over the course of two years has
[29:52] helped them find work build their career
[29:55] literally change the course of their
[29:57] life by you know the ideas patterns

### Minute 30

[30:00] techniques and tools that we discuss on
[30:02] the Channel I want to say you know just
[30:03] massive thank you for for watching for
[30:07] paying attention to the channel you know
[30:09] not not just to the reviewers but to
[30:10] everyone watching right now to you
[30:12] watching right now I'm here because I
[30:15] want to share I want to distribute this
[30:18] technology I want to distribute the
[30:20] potential and the power of this
[30:22] technology you know one of my favorite
[30:24] comments in the previous video when we
[30:26] launched principal AI coding was uh you
[30:28] know someone just said I'm buying this
[30:30] course based on all the value you've
[30:32] already provided on the channel I work
[30:35] really really hard every single week to
[30:37] make sure that I'm providing something
[30:39] valuable for you and for engineers so I
[30:41] really appreciated that comment just to
[30:43] get that you know concrete feedback so
[30:46] without giving too much away principal
[30:48] AI coding is just getting started
[30:51] there's going to be new updates some new
[30:54] content some new ideas this course this
[30:57] resource I built for you is going to be
[30:59] expanding over the course of 2025 so if

### Minute 31

[31:03] you are engaged with principal AI coding
[31:05] if you like the ideas stay tuned I'll
[31:08] make sure to announce it on the channel
[31:10] when new updates are coming to principal
[31:12] a coding that can push your air coding
[31:14] even further Beyond um thank you so much
[31:18] enough blabbing enough promoting this or
[31:21] you know trying to sell this whatever
[31:23] also if you know you don't trust me yet
[31:25] or you know you're new to the channel
[31:27] and you think I'm a grifter or a sleazy
[31:30] sales guy I totally get it you know
[31:32] especially in our world with all the
[31:33] slop and all the you know the grifter
[31:36] and you know people just trying to take
[31:38] advantage of you I completely understand
[31:40] you'll learn that this is a different
[31:42] type of channel that what we do here is
[31:44] truly forward-looking um I'm going to be
[31:47] here every single week releasing
[31:50] valuable information for you anyway
[31:52] let's continue let's move
[31:56] forward I made a a ton of predictions in
[31:59] 2024 I made 41 predictions and I got 36

### Minute 32

[32:03] of them correct so let's quickly just
[32:05] walk through some of these and review
[32:07] what I got right what I got wrong I'll
[32:09] also link last year's predictions video
[32:11] if you're interested in going through
[32:13] kind of Point by point you know full
[32:14] transparency I do not expect to get U
[32:18] anywhere above this even the 70s this
[32:20] time around obviously I'm hoping I do
[32:22] that's why I made the predictions I am
[32:23] betting on them I am super convicted and
[32:25] I'm you know over 2025 I'm going to be
[32:27] putting my energy and time behind every
[32:30] prediction that you just saw at the same
[32:31] time though I realized that you know
[32:33] when you're trying to predict the future
[32:35] uh it is still uh at some level a risk a
[32:38] gamble so on so forth right in 2023 I
[32:41] got 66% right so 16 out of 24 if we look
[32:45] uh year over year over year okay open AI
[32:47] leadership I predicted that open AI
[32:49] continues to lead the AI race I do think
[32:51] that this is still the case they are the
[32:53] leaders when we talk about llms when we
[32:55] talk about uh reshaping the industry
[32:57] with with reasoning models when we talk
[32:59] about you know everyone else playing

### Minute 33

[33:00] playing copy and catchup that's exactly
[33:02] what we saw here over 2025 open AI
[33:05] released A1 and then we saw variants
[33:09] copies and U you know different versions
[33:11] of effectively what are now really well
[33:13] known as raing models uh open source
[33:15] llms I predicted that uh this is so wild
[33:18] to think that we didn't have GPT 3.5
[33:21] level uh models at the beginning of last
[33:24] year that that are open source that was
[33:27] true and so I predicted that that came
[33:29] true obviously we have models that are
[33:31] much better than gbt 3.5 that can run on
[33:34] device okay I predicted an sentience
[33:36] scare I marked this as wrong I don't
[33:39] think there were any true AI sentience
[33:41] scares here's an annoying one I
[33:42] predicted that gp5 would launch and a
[33:45] new architecture would launch we did get
[33:47] a new architecture we got new models but
[33:49] we did not get gbt 5 so this is an
[33:52] incorrect prediction so prompt
[33:54] engineering becomes an essential skill
[33:56] for knowledge workers I think this is
[33:57] pretty uh non-debatable anymore the

### Minute 34

[34:00] power of knowing how to prompt and the
[34:03] power of chat interfaces I think is
[34:05] Undisputed at this point uh I predicted
[34:07] that chat interfaces would be everywhere
[34:09] we'd see widespread adoption over you
[34:12] know massive platforms this is true
[34:14] every real application now basically has
[34:16] a some form of a chat interface okay I
[34:18] predicted we would see more domain
[34:20] specific UI for large language models we
[34:24] are seeing this unfortunately it's still
[34:26] mostly in the shap shape of the chat
[34:28] interface we are seeing this starting to
[34:31] roll out okay so programming predictions
[34:33] I predicted that AI assistant would
[34:35] really take off uh tools like K up
[34:37] copilot cursor whenver AER these are now
[34:39] like pretty essential to a lot of
[34:41] Engineers workflows so you know I think
[34:43] 20124 you could definitely call that the
[34:45] year of AI assistance I think you're
[34:47] going to see that continue into 2025 I
[34:50] predicted that new programmers would be
[34:52] divided into two groups those learning
[34:54] the fundamentals and then asking
[34:56] questions to chat gbt and other llm chat
[34:59] interfaces and then those solely relying

### Minute 35

[35:02] on it we know that one of those groups
[35:04] has been more successful this is the way
[35:06] to learn you do not over rely on chat
[35:10] GPT you use it as a learning mechanism
[35:13] while focusing on the fundamentals okay
[35:15] top languages typescript python kind of
[35:17] an easy Free Bet to make honestly
[35:19] they're popular languages for reason
[35:21] they're easy to read they're easy to
[35:23] understand okay big Tech predictions I
[35:26] predicted there would be a dopamine
[35:27] basting Trend that kind of exploded and
[35:30] then Fizzles out I also predicted that
[35:32] Tik Tok would not get banned this was
[35:34] true it has not been banned yet so I
[35:37] predicted that open AI would join the
[35:38] ranks of big tech companies I think when
[35:40] you think of you know big powerful tech
[35:42] companies now um at least you know when
[35:44] we do that here on the channel we are a
[35:46] lot more plugged into to you know
[35:48] generative AI in general and the
[35:50] generative AI companies um I think we
[35:52] can clearly say and clearly state that
[35:54] open AI is now you know a big powerful
[35:57] tech company with a lot of influence and

### Minute 36

[36:00] it continues to increase so I predicted
[36:01] that Google Gemini would briefly outpace
[36:03] open AI models for quite a bit of time
[36:06] um but this hasn't happened I I don't
[36:08] think even with the latest Gemini Flash
[36:11] and Gemini 2 experimental they are not
[36:13] on par with open ai's 01 model we cannot
[36:16] say that confidently it's getting close
[36:19] but we just saw open AI leap ahead again
[36:22] with 03 all right so I made some stock
[36:24] and crypto predictions here I said S&P
[36:26] 500 would rally and stay above 5,000
[36:29] that happened I predicted Bitcoin goes
[36:31] above 50k uh with the surge of the Black
[36:35] Rock ETF that occurred I think bitcoin's
[36:37] sitting around 90k right now um I
[36:39] predicted that ethereum would eat 20% of
[36:42] market dominance I got this one wrong I
[36:44] predicted that remote work would persist
[36:47] despite return attempts I think it is
[36:49] holding decently here we'll have to see
[36:51] how this trend continues over 2025 and
[36:54] again I kind of made a continuation bet
[36:57] once more this year but I do see that
[36:59] entry and mid level continues to be

### Minute 37

[37:01] oversaturated while senior level job
[37:03] market job positions are in high demand
[37:07] uh we basically saw every frontend role
[37:09] disappear if you're not a senior you
[37:11] know frontend specialist front-end work
[37:14] can be largely um automated and
[37:19] outsourced let's talk about maybe the
[37:21] most important piece of this how do we
[37:23] turn these bets into actions which can
[37:25] give us concrete results you know
[37:26] looking back at my my predictions this
[37:28] is how I'm thinking about 2025 as an
[37:31] engineer who wants to get maximum value
[37:34] for my time and effort okay so when I'm
[37:36] thinking about building products data is
[37:38] gold user experience is silver and
[37:41] language model benchmarks are bronze
[37:43] okay these are the three things that
[37:44] matter the most data ux llm benchmarks I
[37:47] think you can safely assume everything
[37:50] else can be replicated by a competitor
[37:52] with generative AI in fractions of the
[37:55] time it used to take language models are
[37:57] not a moe the right language model plus

### Minute 38

[38:00] your problem plus your data plus your ux
[38:03] plus your benchmarks that's your Moe get
[38:06] good at those things forget everything
[38:08] else right everything else is not
[38:09] defensible Junior and midlevel Engineers
[38:12] my advice to you as you're building up
[38:13] your Genera of AI skills uh you need to
[38:16] specialize to stand out and get hired
[38:18] okay a lot of people will say go broad I
[38:21] don't think that's good advice I also
[38:23] think you should be choosing non-digital
[38:25] or unconventional mediums to connect
[38:27] with people communities companies and
[38:29] opportunities make sure your work is as
[38:32] public as possible and make it
[38:34] absolutely clear you are not a bot make
[38:37] it clear that you are a real human being
[38:39] right be public communicate connect let
[38:41] people know what you're working on use
[38:43] generative AI but do not rely on it for
[38:46] humano human communication do not
[38:49] automate the process of reaching out to
[38:52] people to connecting to uh networking
[38:55] don't automate this okay part of the the
[38:57] reason that the bottom of the job market
[38:59] is falling out is because this is

### Minute 39

[39:01] happening right everyone's trying to
[39:03] automate this that's destroying the job
[39:06] searching process for juniors and
[39:08] mid-level Engineers completely right so
[39:11] do not join that do not become part of
[39:13] the problem Reach Out try to make
[39:15] connections through non-digital or
[39:18] unconventional mediums okay so senior
[39:21] Engineers the shift for us is more about
[39:24] and and really this is for everyone okay
[39:26] so this is for everyone but especially
[39:27] senior plus push yourselves maximize
[39:31] your compute get in the habit of using
[39:33] as much compute as possible for your
[39:35] work if you're coding by hand you're
[39:37] doing it wrong if you're coding by hand
[39:38] there's another engineer that is doing
[39:40] what you're doing much faster with
[39:42] compute and that means you are falling
[39:44] behind maybe not quickly but you are
[39:46] falling behind all right so what else so
[39:50] lock in your AI cing assistance in AI
[39:52] tooling but be ready to switch okay the
[39:55] next big thing is right around the
[39:57] corner AI coding assistant will become
[39:59] the new standard and the code editor

### Minute 40

[40:02] Wars will continue and then agentic
[40:04] coding will become viable right this is
[40:07] happening right now Devon was just
[40:09] released again kind of like looking at
[40:11] that four option pattern to how to get
[40:13] access to new information and tools you
[40:16] know the Devon Engineers are using Devon
[40:18] right and same with their kind of
[40:20] ecosystem it's now publicly available
[40:22] people are starting to use this
[40:23] technology right they have access to it
[40:25] we need to be ready to switch when the
[40:28] next big thing comes while maintaining a
[40:31] strong fundamental understanding of AI
[40:33] coding AI coding is the new standard you
[40:36] know just to plug it one more time this
[40:38] is why I created principled AI coding
[40:40] this is the fast trck for Learning and
[40:43] understanding foundational principles to
[40:46] win with AI coding for today and
[40:48] tomorrow we focus on principles not
[40:51] tools right principles not tools we want
[40:54] to survive all of this noise all of this
[40:57] muck and endure change with principles

### Minute 41

[41:00] okay just be ready to constantly be
[41:02] changing your tools and your models okay
[41:04] so there is no wall and again I'm saying
[41:07] all this from the perspective of my bets
[41:09] that I'm turning into actions okay there
[41:12] is no wall so I'm going to assume llms
[41:14] will continue to improve across all
[41:16] dimensions and build these assumptions
[41:19] into my work products so on and so forth
[41:21] right I'm constantly spending time and
[41:24] energy and money on these top tier
[41:26] models so I can know what's possible so
[41:28] I can use this technology and so that I
[41:31] can know what's possible for the future
[41:34] all right and of course slop is coming
[41:36] so you know hold on to valuable
[41:38] information sources if you're not
[41:39] subscribed to the channel obviously I'm
[41:41] biased this is my channel but I highly
[41:43] recommend you subscribe comment follow
[41:46] stay plugged in you know let the
[41:48] algorithm know you're interested in this
[41:50] especially if you made it this far into
[41:51] the video I've mentioned a couple of my
[41:52] favorite Engineers on the channel a
[41:54] couple times I'll do that again right
[41:56] now and Link them below I'm a huge fan
[41:58] of Simon Willison I look at pretty much

### Minute 42

[42:02] every single one of his posts I check
[42:03] his content almost daily um he's a top
[42:06] tier engineer and I'm super thankful for
[42:08] him shout out Simon Willison and of
[42:10] course Paul the creator of ader all of
[42:12] his work is incredible his tool is
[42:14] incredible uh the entire principal AI
[42:16] coding course would be impossible
[42:18] without that tool and we had to pick a
[42:20] great foundational AI coding tool for
[42:23] this course and it was a no-brainer to
[42:26] choose AER for this so shout out Paul
[42:28] those are two information sources that I
[42:30] stay plugged into quite laterally every
[42:32] single day all right lastly here
[42:34] constantly predict plan and act based on
[42:37] where the ball is where it's going and
[42:39] where you want to be iteratively make
[42:41] predictions plans and execute on your
[42:43] plans the world is dynamic so your plans
[42:46] should be dynamic all right so let me
[42:48] just compress everything one more time
[42:51] you know if if you take nothing away
[42:54] from this video or if you just skip to
[42:55] the end for some reason it is a long
[42:57] video but I think it's an important
[42:59] video this is setting up everything

### Minute 43

[43:00] we're going to be doing on the channel
[43:02] in 2025 here are the top takeaways here
[43:05] are the themes we're going to be hitting
[43:06] over and over again in 2025 okay so here
[43:10] we go max out your compute usage stay
[43:14] plugged in to high value actionable
[43:17] information sources constantly predict
[43:20] plan and act ideas without action are
[43:24] meaningless the theme for 2023 to 2024
[43:28] on the channel was the prompt is the new
[43:31] fundamental unit of knowledge work okay
[43:33] I've said this a million times I will
[43:36] continue to say it this is still
[43:37] relevant in 2025 and Beyond but we have
[43:39] a new theme that's popping up um that is
[43:42] going to be very very important the next
[43:44] theme and I think the big theme for 2025
[43:47] max out your compute if you can gather
[43:50] the right context model impr prompt and
[43:52] hand over your work to your AI
[43:54] assistants why aren't you okay okay this
[43:57] is a huge huge theme and if you can just

### Minute 44

[44:01] focus on this one idea if you ever have
[44:03] the thought oh I definitely could have
[44:04] done that with a language model or with
[44:07] an AI agent or with a little bit of code
[44:08] or with a script that plugs into a an AI
[44:11] agent or working on your personal AI
[44:13] assistant right we're going to be
[44:14] talking about ADA a lot more in 2025
[44:17] because the personal AI assistant is the
[44:19] wrapper around the AI agent which is the
[44:21] rapper around the prompt right but but
[44:24] this is the key theme max out your
[44:26] compute if you can use generative AI why
[44:29] aren't you and if you can't use it what
[44:32] are the blockers remove the blockers a
[44:35] lot of what we're going to do on the
[44:36] channel is talk about removing these
[44:37] blockers building and using the right
[44:39] tooling applications AI assistants AI
[44:42] agents so that we can max out our
[44:45] compute and I mean Max it out if there
[44:48] is a second you don't have a prompt
[44:50] running it's not maxed out okay and and
[44:54] and and that's how extreme we're going
[44:56] to be about this on the channel that
[44:57] there is there is a world where you have
[44:59] an always on machine an always on agent

### Minute 45

[45:04] assistant a gentic workflow whatever it
[45:06] is whatever level of complexity you need
[45:08] imagine you have it always on always
[45:11] working for you building for you while
[45:14] you sleep this is the Northstar for the
[45:16] Andy Dev Dan Channel this is Northstar
[45:18] for all the work that I do and all the
[45:20] work that I do and share on this channel
[45:22] that's where we're headed if you like
[45:24] this video Drop the like drop the sub
[45:27] and drop a comment let me know what you
[45:28] think about my predictions for 2025
[45:31] thanks for watching stay focused and
[45:33] keep building
