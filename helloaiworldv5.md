 Welcome to Principled AI Coding. In this lesson, you'll step into the world of AI coding and begin your journey to obtain superhuman coding abilities. We have one mission in this lesson. Set up your AI tooling and introduce you to fundamental useful AI coding patterns that you can reuse across code bases across time. Every lesson contains one key principle that drives the lesson. In your first lesson here, we're hyper focused on one of the most important design philosophies in software engineering. KISS. Keep it simple, stupid. This is one of my all-time favorite principles because it's relevant for beginners and seniors. It reminds us not to overthink things, especially when we're learning something new. Whenever you're learning something new, it can be easy to veer of course, get distracted, feel overwhelmed or confused. If you ever feel that way in this lesson or throughout the course, remember, keep it simple, stupid. Even the greatest engineers fall off track, get distracted and hit roadblocks. If this happens, if you get distracted, if you fall off course, refocus, all your attention on the fundamentals will cover right now. There's so much information out there. So many things happening, so many decisions to be made, so many opinions to be heard. But right now, all you need to do is focus in on this very moment. I've taken all the complexity, all the information, all the decision making, and I've abstracted it away for you. All we're doing here is setting up your AI tooling and running your first set of AI coding prompts. That's it. Keep it simple, all the way through. In your first lesson, you'll step into the world of AI coding and begin your journey to obtain super human coding abilities. Now, let's get you set up with the essentials. I'm going to show the prerequisites on the screen. If you're missing any of these, go ahead, pause the video, your loot box below will contain every link you need to get set up. Install these and come back when you're ready. Now, let's open up the terminal and validate that you have everything you need to be successful here. We're going to run UV dash dash version. Perfect. We'll run Git dash dash version. Perfect. Python dash dash version. Perfect. And pip dash dash version. Perfect. Now, go ahead and create a directory where we can clone and download the lesson one code base. Now, let's clone the lesson one code base. This is going to be a link in your loot box below. Now that I've cloned this, I'll type LS and CD into this code base. And now, let's install your new AI coding assistant, Aitor. We're going to use this command to install Aitor. Remember, every command you see in this video is going to be available in your loot box below. We'll install Aitor. After install, we can run Aitor dash dash version. This lets you know that you have Aitor installed. Nice work. Last, but not least, we need a language model to power our AI coding assistant. In this lesson, we'll need an open AI API key, but I also recommend preparing an anthropic API key as well. We're not going to worry too much in this lesson about what model is going to run. We're just here to set up the basics. If you need it, we'll have a link below in your loot box that will walk you through the process of how to obtain both of these keys. Remember, do not share your API keys with anyone. After you obtain your API key, you can set them in the command line like this. Export open AI key equals and then go ahead and paste your API key here. I'm going to cut this part out of the video so that I don't leak my API key to you. If you have an anthropic key, you can go ahead and use this command. Of course, this is going to be available in your loot box below as all of our commands will be. If you're on Windows, check out the link in your loot box for setting up and exporting your key on a Windows machine. This course was designed so that you can optionally work with me in parallel. That's definitely the preferred way. You'll get more out of it and you'll understand the concepts in real time. But of course, you can sit back, relax and just absorb this information passively as well. We're almost there. Let's go ahead and open up your favorite code editor inside this repository. I'm going to use VS code throughout this course. So I'll just type code dot. All right, so you can see we have a simple Python application. We're going to be working in our main file here when go ahead and open this up. And now it's time to write your first AI coding prompt with Aitor. Go ahead and open a terminal inside your repository. I'm going to use VS codes terminal with the command J hotkey. And now if you have everything set up properly, you should be able to type Aitor. You'll likely have a future Aitor version and you might have a different main model specified. The key thing to pay attention to is that you should see something like this. Get repo with five files. I'm going to go ahead and hit control L to clear the command line interface. And now we're going to give Aitor some files to work with. We're going to type slash add space main dot p y. Now Aitor can see the main dot p y file. I'm going to type control L. Again, you'll see me do this quite a bit throughout the course. And now we're going to write your first AI coding prompt. All we're going to do here is type of print hello AI coding world. You can see Aitor automatically made that change. We now have a print statement here in this file. And Aitor now may be asking you a couple questions. It knows that we're operating in Python. So it's asking us if we want to run the shell command. We'll go ahead and type y for yes. And now you can see Aitor went ahead and ran the commands. You can see our print statement hello AI coding world. And now Aitor's asking, do you want to add the command output to the chat? As you write code with Aitor, it's constantly keeping track of everything you've discussed all the inputs and all the outputs. We're just going to go ahead and hit yes here. Now Aitor can see the command we ran and the output of that command. If you made it this far and you ran this, congratulations. You just wrote code using AI. Before we dive into the model or additional commands or anything, let's remember to keep it simple and just continue to explore what we can do with this. Let's run some additional AI coding prompts. I want to give you a fundamental understanding of what you can do with your new AI coding tool. I'll type a control L again. Let's go ahead and modify this main file with additional AI coding prompts. Let's run update to print 10 times. Perfect. And then we'll go ahead. We'll say yes. Aitor wants to know if we want to run the shell command again. We'll go ahead and say yes. And you can see there we now have 10 hello AI coding world prints. We'll add the output to Aitor's chat window and then we'll go ahead and clear once more. You can see here same deal once again automatically. The code was updated for us. All we're doing is typing in natural language. Let's push it further. We'll say store string in variable and pass into print. Perfect. So same deal. We're going to hit yes, once again the code was automatically written for us and we have 10 hello AI coding world and we added that again to Aitor's chat window. I stopped. Let's go ahead and push this further. When you're writing code with AI at the beginning, we want to keep things simple and focused on making one change at a time to understand the technology at a fundamental level. Let's go ahead and move this code into a function. So we're just going to go ahead and literally type that. We'll say move the print into a function and pass in the variable. Perfect. So now we have a message as a variable. And now it's getting passed in to a brand new function that we just wrapped and we're doing the same thing, right printing 10 times. We'll go ahead and hit yes. We'll hit yes. And now we're moving, now we're making progress. We haven't written a single line of code and that will be a reoccurring trend throughout this course. You and I are very, very rarely going to actually write individual lines of code. In the age of generative AI, there will be fewer and fewer times where you'll actually want to go in and write code yourself unless you're correcting something. A good sign that you're making progress, writing code with AI is that you're not manually updating code yourself. Let's clear the terminal. So let's go ahead and run one more prompt. So we're going to keep things simple while progressing. I'll introduce you to one additional command that's really important for managing your mistakes and your assistance mistakes. We're software engineers. This is bound to happen. At some point, you're going to make a mistake. The only question is how quickly can you roll it back and get to the correct solution? We're going to write this prompt, comment out all code and our egg coding assistant will automatically take care of this for us. Great. So you can see that's all commented out. And now what we're going to do is use this new command slash undo. So if we type slash undo and hit enter, you can see there that change just got completely reverted. It doesn't matter what was in that change in future lessons. We're going to be updating many, many, many files with our AI coding assistant. The slash undo command will literally move you back in time before that specific prompt was wrong. This is a really important command to correct mistakes quickly. Everyone falls at some point. The question is how quickly do you get back up after you've fallen? slash undo is your instant get back up command. Let's go ahead and clear the terminal again. And so I just want to highlight what you've accomplished here. This is nothing short of incredible. Right? I know that this is a super, super simple example. And if you have experience, you're probably glossing over how simple this is. But this is really important. Right? Nothing is more important than the groundwork you lay for yourself. You're leveraging natural language to instruct your AI coding assistant effectively reducing the gap between your ideas and executable code. There are a few things to keep in mind here as you continue your AI coding journey. As you work with additional files, refining your prompts will be crucial to ensuring accuracy and efficiency. Remember, large language models and AI coding assistants are tools to augment your capabilities. Now replace them more than ever. We are moving to code reviewers and code key readers. Dump in amateur that doesn't know what they're creating. You have to know what you're looking for in order to see it. You have to know the end state that the AI coding assistant will get you to at least at a high level in order to create it. So how does this work at a high level? How do AI coding assistants work at a high level? Our AI coding assistant here, Aitor sits on top of a large language model. While models will evolve over time, you might be using a next generation model. The core principle and the architecture remains the same. The large language model is what generates the code for you. We then add files. In our example here, we have a single main.py file and files are also known as context, right? This is information that your prompts and your AI coding assistant can operate on. This is information that Aitor can explicitly read. As you progress and write in larger code bases, this explicit file adding becomes ultra important because Aitor reads those files and those files alone. There's some small copy us of that. Sometimes Aitor will ask you to add additional files. If it thinks something is missing based on your prompt, but for 99% of the cases, the files you've explicitly added, that's what your AI coding assistant will be able to see and operate on. There are some AI coding tools that have some magical patterns and some magical auto matching to try to automatically pull in context that thinks might be relevant for you. There are advantages and disadvantages to that. Lastly, we write AI coding prompts that Aitor passes to the LLM which writes your code. Aitor takes the generation, validates it, and saves it to your file. These are the three essential elements of true AI coding assistants. Context, model, and prompt. These are essential ideas. We'll discuss in our next lesson, Multi-File Editing. Now that you've written a few AI coding prompts, let's apply your skills to a practical project, building a word frequency counter. This exercise will put your learning to work and demonstrate the power of AI coding assistants. The frequency of words in a string gives you a rough estimate of the central theme or topic. This can be useful for simple yet effective data analysis on presentations of any kind. You can use this on YouTube videos, on conference presentations, on work meetings, and really any presentation that can be transcribed into a single block of text. You can see here we have this transcript.txt file in this starter code base. This is a transcription from a YouTube video. We're going to use this and count the frequency of each word in this script. So we're going to do this in just four AI coding prompts in under one minute. I'm going to clear the main file and we'll start the timer as soon as I open Aitor. Let's go. I'll type Aitor. I'll add the main file. Then I'll say read transcribed.txt and set to var. Great. I'll skip the outputs and then I'll say count the frequency of each word using a dict to store counts. Great. Then I'll say display the word frequencies by printing hashtag for each count. Awesome. And then finally I'll say sort descending before print. Sweet. And then we'll stop the time there. Moment of truth. Open up a new terminal. Then I'll type python main. You can see here we have all the words and frequencies for each one and if we just go ahead scroll to the top here we're going to see some larger frequencies showing the number of times towards appear. Obviously you can see there are common words like and the two of you that are very very common and if we scroll down you can of course see AI start to pop up. You can see file and then you can see loops so on and so forth. So in just four prompts in under a minute you know we have this really simple working file. This is just a taste of the potential of what you can do with these AI coding tools. This is a simple application that can be written in a lot more simplistic ways but the ease in which you're able to build something like this really needs to be highlighted. The simplicity of AI coding allows you to focus on the outcome and structure of your program while the AI handles the repetitive lower level details. AI coding shortens the gap between what we want to create and it existing. For example we can make a couple quick tweaks to this program to make it a lot more useful. Let's say we only want to display words that show up more than three times and let's say we also want to have the total printed alongside the word. We can literally just open up Aitor, add the file again and then just type nearly exactly what we just said. Only show words with count greater than three. Use a variable and then we'll use a period here to denote that we want multiple changes. This is a small thing that adds up over time and then we'll say after word before hashtag show the total for the word. Okay and then we'll just kick that off. So we'll be able to watch the code getting written here in real time. You can see we have the men count threshold and then we have the loop now running at the bottom here. So let's go ahead exit Aitor here and type path on main or you can go ahead and just use Aitor to kick this off and we'll hit enter and you can see here now now we're only seeing words here that have three or more occurrences and we also have the total between the word and the hashtag. There are many ways to tweak and improve this of course. We might want to filter out a lot of these common words. So this is awesome right really simple program lots more we can do here. Tons of ways we can improve but now you have a great groundwork for what's coming next. As you continue to develop your AI coding skills you'll find that AI coding can significantly speed up your development workflow allowing you to tackle more complex projects with ease. So what's next you now have the basics and the fundamentals. You can start to see how this tool can give you super human coding abilities and our next lessons will build upon what we've learned here and explore multi-pal editing and context management. This will enable you to manage real coding projects effectively. We'll also learn additional commands to better manage your AI coding sessions. If we open Aitor and type slash you'll notice a large list of commands. We're going to cover and focus on the commands that matter the most for your AI coding journey. We're going to learn the most important commands one by one incrementally. We'll learn how to add additional files remove files change the language model and track your token usage so that you can monitor your costs using these tools. Just a quick note on pricing and tokens your time is worth a lot more than a few bucks here or there. I definitely recommend you eat the costs and use them the higher quality state of the art models. So let's quick review what we've done here right we set up our AI coding assistant Aitor we kept things super simple we just focused on getting value out of your AI coding assistant. We ran basic AI coding prompts to break the ice and then we built a small transcript analytics application in less than a minute and we did it by keeping things simple and focused on the core value that AI coding tools offer you rapid natural language code generation. This is AI coding you are AI coding that's what this lesson was about and you made it to the end here. Great job keep the kiss principle as your guiding star as we work through upcoming lessons things will get more complex. We're going to be doing more with their AI coding prompts. We're going to be using complex reasoning models that are able to generate five 10 plus files for us with a single prompt. We're going to be refactoring large swaths of code. We're going to be creating reading updating and deleting multiple files. We're going to be working more complex commands powerful AI coding patterns and brand new ways to write code in the age of generative AI. Throughout all of it remember this lesson remember the core of what's happening here. Rapid natural language code generation keep the kiss principle close to you as your guiding star as we work through these lessons together. Focus on keeping your AI coding prompts simple direct and focused to better harness the full power of AI coding. If you write a prompt that you don't understand how to turn into running code double check your prompt add in your detail and make sure you know what you're trying to generate makes you know the outcome you're looking for. I'll see you in the next lesson where we'll dive into multi file editing to expand your AI coding capabilities. Check your loop box to see everything you've unlocked by watching this lesson. I highly recommend you walk through everything we've done here and power up for what's coming next. Great work here and I'll see you in the next lesson where we'll dive into multi file editing to push your AI coding capabilities to the next level.
