### Minute 0

[00:00] in this video I want to share my current
[00:02] vision of the future of engineering with
[00:04] you this is my plan for how to win in
[00:07] 2025 in this Vision you and I wield
[00:10] generative ai ai agents and AI
[00:13] assistants to gather data synthesize it
[00:16] and build at rates that are completely
[00:19] absurd by today's standard there are
[00:21] four key advancements in AI tooling that
[00:24] occurred this year that's unlocked the
[00:26] path to Next Generation AI engineering
[00:30] Sonic 3.5 structured outputs 01
[00:32] reasoning models and of course the
[00:34] real-time API before we discuss the
[00:37] future of engineering let me share
[00:39] version three of ADA the personal AI
[00:41] assistant for engineering we've been
[00:43] building up on the
[00:50] channel hey adah hi there how can I help
[00:53] go ahead and pull in our SQL tables into
[00:55] your active
[00:57] memory tables loaded into memory create

### Minute 1

[01:00] a markdown document and inside of it
[01:02] just lay out our table definitions sure
[01:05] I'll get started on the markdown
[01:08] document markdown document created n
[01:11] shaba go ahead and select all of our
[01:13] products uh order descending by
[01:18] Price SQL query save to file great AA go
[01:21] ahead and execute that and uh generate a
[01:24] CSV file for
[01:26] US query executed results saved as CSV
[01:38] a generate the SQL for our top 10
[01:41] products with the highest average rating
[01:43] create a CSV file for
[01:47] US top 10 products with highest average
[01:50] rating save the
[01:52] CSV wonderful Ada can you go ahead and
[01:55] generate a python let's do a bar chart
[01:58] and on the x-axis use our product name

### Minute 2

[02:00] on the Y show the average rating please
[02:03] python code for bar chart generated it's
[02:05] saved in top 10 highest average rating
[02:08] products bar chart
[02:10] Pat ay to go ahead and delete that bar
[02:13] chart.png file and the python generation
[02:16] code Force delete
[02:21] that both files deleted get our top 10
[02:25] products by order volume sort descending
[02:28] create a CSV file for
[02:31] us top 10 products by order volume saved
[02:34] as
[02:36] CSV wonderful Ada go ahead and create a
[02:39] python chart let's do a bar chart of the
[02:41] top 10 products here based on our CSV
[02:47] file python code for bar chart generated
[02:50] it's saved in top 10 products by order
[02:53] volume bar chart. py

### Minute 3

[03:03] wonderful thanks ad up you're
[03:08] welcome so the personal AI assistant you
[03:12] just saw is powered by the real-time API
[03:15] structured outputs and the 01 reasing
[03:17] model it showcases a glimpse of How High
[03:20] performing Engineers will maximize their
[03:23] output with compute in 2025 and Beyond
[03:26] Ada and the personal a assistant are
[03:28] only possible du due to key AI tooling
[03:31] breakthroughs that happened this year in
[03:33] 2024 the word on the street is we're
[03:36] going to see one additional release
[03:38] occur as well likely from anthropic but
[03:41] we'll see about that I think whatever
[03:42] comes out we've already had the key
[03:44] breakthroughs we need to redesign and
[03:47] rethink how we engineer in 2025 so why
[03:50] are these tools important what do they
[03:51] unlock they allow us to continue
[03:53] upleveling our generative AI composes
[03:56] the pieces that when you stack them
[03:57] together lead to the next level of

### Minute 4

[04:00] software engineering right we have
[04:01] prompt design we have ai agents we now
[04:04] have the AI assistant which is
[04:06] effectively our orchestration layer it
[04:08] allows us to control our AI agents
[04:10] eventually that will lead us to fullon
[04:12] agentic where we'll build an own self
[04:16] operating software over the past two
[04:18] videos we've been digging into the AI
[04:20] assistant thanks to the real-time API
[04:23] this is a massive unlock for in parallel
[04:26] engineering where your AI assistant can
[04:28] work for you on your beh behalf while
[04:30] you're accomplishing other tasks it's a
[04:32] work in progress there are many things
[04:33] to improve but it absolutely showcases
[04:36] what the future of engineer can and will
[04:38] look like right now you myself and other
[04:41] Engineers that watch this channel are
[04:43] likely few of many that realize when you
[04:45] put these breakthroughs together and
[04:47] when you start composing your generative
[04:49] AI pieces from prompts to AI agents to
[04:52] assistants you start building software
[04:54] in a brand new way as an orchestrator as
[04:57] a manager and Commander of compute this

### Minute 5

[05:00] is going to be a big theme of software
[05:02] engineering in 2025 if you're looking
[05:05] for those outsize returns and if you're
[05:07] looking for Next Level productivity as
[05:10] an engineer The Prompt is the new
[05:12] fundamental unit of knowledge work never
[05:14] forget this and yes you heard that here
[05:16] first let's start from scratch what does
[05:18] it mean to be an engineer right this is
[05:20] you the engineer and the center what do
[05:22] we do as Engineers we take data in we
[05:25] ingest data and then we synthesize it
[05:28] into some form of output right some
[05:31] artifacts this is software engineering
[05:34] in its most fundamental form I've
[05:36] stripped out all the details here this
[05:38] is what we do we take an information and
[05:40] we synthesize outputs let's dig a Little
[05:42] Deeper right let's go a layer into this
[05:44] so data for engineers is typically
[05:46] databases code bases documentation blogs
[05:49] Trends news research tools it's your job
[05:52] to ingest this information and for your
[05:55] personal work for your tools for your
[05:57] career for your job is your job to then

### Minute 6

[06:00] synthesize everything coming at you into
[06:03] useful output let's break down output
[06:06] this is going to be code information and
[06:08] research media content and products
[06:11] these are the top four of course there
[06:13] are many other things engineers can
[06:15] build and synthesize there is some
[06:17] overlap here but you get the idea right
[06:19] your job as an engineer is to ingest
[06:21] these types of content and then
[06:23] synthesize code information research
[06:25] media and products if we simplify what
[06:28] it means to be an engineer this is what
[06:29] we do but now things have changed so as
[06:32] you know there are hidden layers here in
[06:34] this process for how this ingestion and
[06:37] how this synthesizing actually happens
[06:40] now we have ai tooling so let's break
[06:43] down the AI tooling we can now use to
[06:45] ingest and synthesize information okay
[06:48] we now have prompts this is the new
[06:50] fundamental unit of knowledge work if
[06:53] you master the prompt you will Master
[06:55] knowledge work full stop what's the next
[06:57] level at the next level we have AI

### Minute 7

[07:00] agents AI agents are prompts and logic
[07:03] combined with data to solve a specific
[07:06] problem if you've been using the latest
[07:08] generation AI coding tools you using one
[07:10] or more AI agents right that is a tool
[07:12] that wraps logic code and UI on top of
[07:17] what the base level right the llm the
[07:20] entire Revolution that's happening right
[07:22] now is powered entirely by large
[07:24] language models these are our text
[07:26] models these are our vision models this
[07:27] is a generative AI power house if the
[07:30] llm did not happen nothing else happens
[07:33] nothing else comes without the llm
[07:35] nothing else comes without the prompt
[07:36] the AI agents compose one or more
[07:39] prompts to solve a specific problem in a
[07:42] specific system at the next level we now
[07:45] have your orchestration layer this is
[07:47] what we've been working on on the
[07:48] channel over the previous two videos
[07:50] right this is Ada this is our personal
[07:51] AI assistant it doesn't need to have
[07:53] speech to speech capabilities it's just
[07:55] a killer fast interface for our
[07:58] orchestration layer the the key

### Minute 8

[08:00] differentiation here is that your AI
[08:02] assistant allows you to orchestrate many
[08:04] AI agents across use cases right and
[08:07] that's what separates this layer from
[08:10] previous tools a lot of the tools you're
[08:11] going to see are built with specific use
[08:13] cases built to solve a specific problem
[08:15] that's great that's still a wrapper
[08:17] around several AI agents the
[08:19] orchestration layer or your personal AI
[08:21] assistant is all about helping you do
[08:24] what you need to do across all the
[08:26] domains that you operate in and then at
[08:27] the last level we have a g
[08:30] so these are fullon what I like to call
[08:32] living pieces of software that operate
[08:35] on your behalf while you sleep a while
[08:37] back I put out a video called the
[08:39] two-way prompt and you know at the end I
[08:42] described this new piece of software
[08:44] agentic software where um you're no
[08:46] longer prompting your AI it is now
[08:49] prompting you for what it needs to do
[08:52] next right it's gotten that good so this
[08:54] is the last stage this is where we're
[08:56] going on the channel this is our North
[08:57] Star let me be totally clear this this
[08:59] is you know a 3 5 10 year goal and

### Minute 9

[09:03] journey this isn't happening anytime
[09:05] soon this is insurmountably
[09:07] nontrivial okay so how does that change
[09:09] things right how does that tie to my
[09:11] plan for engineering in 2025 uh it's
[09:14] really this simple now you should be
[09:16] asking yourself given all of my tasks
[09:18] where I'm ingesting and synthesizing how
[09:20] can I use generative AI to help me do
[09:23] these things faster better or cheaper or
[09:27] all three because that's where the real
[09:29] productivity gains really come in and
[09:31] just to throw some rough estimates on
[09:33] here utilizing tools that give you
[09:35] access to language models is you know
[09:38] relative to each other you know that's
[09:40] the first step right that's your initial
[09:42] 2x when you start using specialized
[09:44] agents to solve problems rapidly over
[09:46] and over that's going to get you to your
[09:48] you know your next huge incremental bump
[09:51] right and I don't actually know what the
[09:52] scale is this is just the way I've felt
[09:55] it over time so far right this is your
[09:57] 5x now this 10x is something I'm still
[09:59] working on right I literally just showed

### Minute 10

[10:01] you a version of ADA that gives us an
[10:02] orchestration layer on top of any set of
[10:05] AI agents okay so this is our
[10:07] orchestration layer I'm really excited
[10:08] about this the real- time speech to
[10:10] speech plus reasoning models plus
[10:12] structured outputs really enables this
[10:14] right for me the vision is complete for
[10:17] the orchestration layer and then there's
[10:19] the last level and and you know I don't
[10:22] even know if uh 10x from here is the
[10:25] right amount if it's 100x um it's
[10:27] probably much higher than that when you
[10:29] have this fully autonomous being this
[10:32] fully autonomous piece of software
[10:33] operating on your behalf it's probably
[10:35] much higher than this we're saving that
[10:37] for later this is a more faded outline
[10:39] for a reason um that's the North Star
[10:41] it's always to keep the North Star in
[10:43] your mind but realistically we're
[10:45] focused here 2 5 10 these are all
[10:48] attainable productivity gains you can
[10:50] get right now it's all about asking the
[10:54] question during my ingestion tasks when
[10:56] I'm looking through databases writing
[10:58] queries when I'm reading code trying to

### Minute 11

[11:00] determine how to modify this feature or
[11:03] add this new feature to this code base
[11:04] or looking through documentation or
[11:06] gathering information for an
[11:08] architectural decision you need to make
[11:10] right it's now about asking yourself the
[11:12] question how can I best use one of these
[11:15] layers of AI tooling to help me ingest
[11:18] and synthesize that's really what it's
[11:20] about let's look at a concrete example
[11:22] right the most obvious example is code
[11:24] generation this is the lowest possible
[11:26] hanging fruit in the age of generative
[11:28] AI for software engineer
[11:29] it's definitely one of the most
[11:30] important but it is so overhyped it's so
[11:34] insanely overhyped right now and what
[11:36] are examples of this right now
[11:37] everyone's using cursor everyone's using
[11:38] ader continue Zed it's a really hot
[11:41] space right now and you know this is the
[11:43] you know 5x so if you're using AI code
[11:45] tooling right now you're in a great spot
[11:47] right because you know what that feels
[11:48] like to be able to write a prompt and
[11:50] generate massive amounts of code so that
[11:53] is a concrete example of using AI
[11:55] tooling to both ingest and synthesize
[11:57] information code generation is
[11:59] incredible but it's only a small piece

### Minute 12

[12:02] of the puzzle as a software engineer you
[12:04] just saw me working on a mock doc
[12:06] database instance with Ada we able to
[12:09] quickly read ingest and write SQL
[12:13] statements with artifacts in real time
[12:16] very very
[12:17] quickly um you know you saw that all
[12:19] happen just now right and and that's
[12:22] that's me tapping into this you know
[12:24] orchestration layer Advantage right I
[12:26] was still only effectively using these
[12:28] closely related agents all closely
[12:30] related to um SQL generation right like
[12:32] if we uh crank open that code base you
[12:35] can see I've got the tools here
[12:37] separated by use case and so you know we
[12:39] used all the SQL database operations we
[12:42] also used the AI chat history management
[12:44] tools and a few other ones here right we
[12:47] use create an update file of course you
[12:49] know what we're doing here is we're
[12:50] starting to tap into these these cross
[12:53] domain actions where it's not just about
[12:55] writing an SQL statement it's about
[12:58] reading tables it's about writing

### Minute 13

[13:00] documentation on the tables it's about
[13:01] understanding the structure of the
[13:03] database it's about generating multiple
[13:05] versions it's about generating diagrams
[13:07] and documentation right software
[13:09] engineering is so much more than just
[13:10] writing code this whole anyone can write
[13:13] code narrative is so overblown it's very
[13:17] true anyone can generate code with AI
[13:19] but can you build and maintain software
[13:22] that actually produces value for a user
[13:26] that's a whole different story right
[13:28] that's a whole different story story
[13:29] coding isn't everything and that's why
[13:31] it's important for you the engineer to
[13:33] understand that you need to match up
[13:35] your ingestion tasks with the highest
[13:38] composition level of AI that you
[13:40] possibly can and then do the same thing
[13:42] when you're synthesizing results right
[13:44] and actually outputting you know your
[13:45] artifacts and your output and your raw
[13:47] content so what is my plan in 2025 given
[13:51] this setup my plan is the same as I just
[13:53] described I am looking through all of
[13:55] the cases and all the situations where
[13:57] I'm ingesting and synthes exing and then
[13:59] I'm asking myself how often do I do this

### Minute 14

[14:02] and how important is it that I have this
[14:05] problem solved at record speeds record
[14:08] time faster than ever with generative Ai
[14:11] and the more important it is the more
[14:13] you need to push the problem up this
[14:16] composition chain if you generate
[14:18] documentation once a month you're
[14:20] probably cool to just open up chat GPT
[14:23] run a random ad hoc prompt and just get
[14:26] the job done but if you're building new
[14:28] features and your architecting systems
[14:30] on a weekly or daily basis you probably
[14:34] want a specialized AI agent and more
[14:36] likely an AI assistant to help you
[14:38] accomplish that task but also closely
[14:41] related task right next to it right so
[14:43] you probably want to build or find an
[14:45] entire AI assistant with the right AI
[14:48] agents inside of it to help you
[14:49] accomplish those tasks at a rapid Pace
[14:52] right and that's what it's really all
[14:53] about what operations consume the most
[14:56] of your time and based on that answer
[14:58] you you should be pushing that up this

### Minute 15

[15:01] generative AI composition chain if it's
[15:03] a one-off task open up Claud open up
[15:05] Gemini open up chat GPT fire a prompt
[15:08] off a CLI right it doesn't really matter
[15:11] but as soon as that use case comes back
[15:13] right it's just like typical rules of
[15:15] automation as soon as that happens I
[15:17] like three times as a pattern then you
[15:19] should be building a reusable prompt
[15:22] after that happens build an AI agent it
[15:24] can be a script it can be a small tool
[15:26] it can be an entire application but when
[15:28] that problem comes again and again and
[15:29] again you should be thinking about
[15:31] automating it right and I've listed the
[15:33] most common operations here for software
[15:36] Engineers so it's a good place to start
[15:37] here we all have to interact with
[15:38] databases so you should have your SQL
[15:41] your om your data access layers
[15:45] streamlined by AI tooling right same
[15:47] thing with code bases you should be able
[15:49] to read find fly through code bases with
[15:53] generative AI tooling you should be able
[15:54] to also consume documentation and
[15:57] understand and Gro documentation with AI
[15:59] tooling it's the same deal here right

### Minute 16

[16:01] blogs Trends news research you should be
[16:02] able to filter out the things that don't
[16:05] matter and while there are so many
[16:06] things that don't matter there's so much
[16:07] noise in the world this section here is
[16:10] becoming really really important for
[16:11] engineering uh there's so much just
[16:13] garbage coming out right now and um you
[16:16] know just useless Echo chambering type
[16:20] information is really important to you
[16:23] know filter out you know get good
[16:24] reliable channels of information so so
[16:27] cut up each one of those ingestion use
[16:30] cases see how often you do them the more
[16:32] often the more important they are you
[16:35] should be delegating these items out to
[16:37] your slew of prompts AI agents and soon
[16:41] hopefully AI assistant same thing on the
[16:43] synthesizing step right the most common
[16:45] things we do as Engineers we code we
[16:48] create information and research we
[16:50] generate media and we output full-on
[16:53] products right code and products is
[16:55] probably the most popular one for most
[16:57] Engineers Okay so these things need to

### Minute 17

[17:00] be super super locked in I probably
[17:02] should have explicitly added
[17:03] documentation but it kind of fits under
[17:05] information as well but you get the
[17:07] point right like these these are the
[17:09] first things to go after when you're
[17:11] trying to figure out what do I focus on
[17:13] what do I automate right and this is my
[17:15] plan for 2025 is to take all of my
[17:17] ingestion tasks and all of my
[17:19] synthesizing tasks and make sure that I
[17:23] can lean on generative AI tooling to
[17:25] help me accomplish that goal so I have
[17:28] three big things things queued up to
[17:30] share before the year ends that can
[17:31] accelerate your engineering we're going
[17:33] to dive into meta prompting Concepts
[17:36] right we're going to start dipping our
[17:38] toes into what it looks like to get this
[17:41] 100x uh keep in mind that you don't jump
[17:44] between these productivity improvements
[17:46] you it takes a long time to transition
[17:49] and sometimes you're operating right out
[17:51] of chat gbt right getting the lower uh
[17:54] productivity gains and then other times
[17:56] you're going to use a specific tool or
[17:58] slew of Agents um I am going to be

### Minute 18

[18:01] working really hard to get Ada off the
[18:03] ground and make her as useful as
[18:06] possible for real software engineering
[18:08] because the gains here are just
[18:09] incredible so we're going to be digging
[18:11] into meta prompting I'll be releasing
[18:13] the AI coding course I'm really really
[18:16] excited about that I've been working
[18:17] really really hard for honestly over
[18:19] half a year now on this course this is
[18:21] going to make you a master of AI coding
[18:23] tools the tools of today and tomorrow I
[18:26] want you to win not just today but
[18:28] tomorrow next year the year after so I'm
[18:31] really excited to share that that'll be
[18:32] closer toward the end of the year likely
[18:34] December and then finally we'll be
[18:36] continuing to push on the capabilities
[18:38] of Next Generation AI tooling with a
[18:40] focus on of course shipping software
[18:43] from AI coding to crafting powerful
[18:46] prompts to deploying AI agents and
[18:47] building out our personal AI assistant
