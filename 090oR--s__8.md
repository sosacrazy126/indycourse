### Minute 0

[00:00] this is a video where it's better to
[00:02] show not tell we'll discuss how powerful
[00:05] AI assistance can be for your
[00:07] engineering especially in 2025 after the
[00:10] demo while you're watching this feel
[00:11] free to comment and share what
[00:13] capabilities you would want your
[00:16] engineering personal AI assistant to
[00:18] have
[00:31] hey
[00:32] adah hey Dan how can I help you
[00:41] today a to go ahead and scrape to a file
[00:44] from my
[00:50] [Music]
[00:54] clipboard the content has been
[00:56] successfully scraped and saved to the
[00:58] file structured outputs introduction

### Minute 1

[01:00] guide. MD is there anything else you
[01:03] would like to do with this
[01:09] file AA can you go ahead and update the
[01:12] structured outputs introduction guide
[01:14] file let's go ahead and clean it up
[01:16] remove some of the formatting we have
[01:17] some lists of numbers that don't need to
[01:19] be there let's just clean it up and
[01:21] focus on the use case of structured
[01:23] outputs and the code examples
[01:26] surrounding it use a reasoning model for
[01:27] this
[01:30] [Music]
[01:39] the structured outputs introduction
[01:41] guide has been cleaned up and revised
[01:43] with a focus on the use case of
[01:45] structured outputs and relevant code
[01:47] examples the reasoning model was used
[01:50] for this task ni J ad go ahead and load
[01:54] that file into our active memory
[01:58] [Music]

### Minute 2

[02:00] the structured outputs introduction
[02:02] guide file has been loaded into our
[02:04] active memory how can I assist you
[02:06] further nice job beta go ahead and use
[02:09] the structured outputs introduction
[02:11] guide as an example and let's create a
[02:13] new python file with examples on how
[02:17] exactly to use structured outputs go
[02:20] ahead and create a new file a new python
[02:22] file for us with runable code use your
[02:24] reasoning model for this
[02:28] [Music]
[02:35] the python file structured outputs
[02:37] examples. py has been created with
[02:39] examples on how to use structured
[02:41] outputs feel free to check it out and
[02:44] run the
[02:54] code all right a can you go ahead and
[02:56] run that code for us go ahead and run
[02:58] python on that file

### Minute 3

[03:01] [Music]
[03:06] the code in structured outputs examples.
[03:08] py has been run successfully would you
[03:11] like to see the
[03:12] output no that's okay I have it right
[03:14] here I can see the output here in this
[03:15] file thank
[03:18] you you're welcome if you need any more
[03:21] help just let me
[03:45] a to go ahead and scrape to a file from
[03:48] my clipboard go ahead and take this URL
[03:50] scrape it create a markdown document for
[03:54] [Music]
[03:57] us the content from the URL has been

### Minute 4

[04:00] scraped and saved to a markdown document
[04:02] named openis swarm overview. MD let me
[04:07] know if you need any further
[04:11] assistance cool yeah let's go ahead and
[04:13] just discuss this file uh just briefly
[04:16] tell me what this is all about what is
[04:18] open AI
[04:22] [Music]
[04:27] swarm the file outlines open AI swarm
[04:31] which is an experimental educational
[04:33] framework for multi-agent
[04:35] orchestration it showcases concepts for
[04:38] coordinating and executing agents
[04:41] primarily using the chat completions
[04:43] API open AI swarm is designed for
[04:46] educational purposes rather than
[04:48] production allowing developers to
[04:50] explore lightweight scalable and
[04:52] customizable agent patterns and
[04:54] functions okay can you walk me through a
[04:56] couple use cases of this let's just keep
[04:59] discussing our open AI swarm overview

### Minute 5

[05:01] document what are some use cases of this
[05:04] and how does it differ from other
[05:06] multi-agent
[05:08] [Music]
[05:12] tools open AI swarm is designed to help
[05:15] developers learn about multi-agent
[05:17] orchestration through an educational
[05:19] approach it emphasizes lightweight
[05:22] ergonomic agent orchestration with a
[05:24] focus on handoffs and
[05:26] routines some use cases for open AI
[05:28] swarm you developers can use it to
[05:31] understand and experiment with
[05:33] multi-agent systems Dynamics without the
[05:35] complexities of a full production
[05:37] environment it is useful for developers
[05:39] to explore different agent coordination
[05:42] and execution patterns open AI swarm
[05:44] differs from other multi-agent tools in
[05:47] the following ways experimental and
[05:50] educational it is built for exploration
[05:52] and learning rather than for deployment
[05:55] in a production environment
[05:57] statelessness unlike some established
[05:59] tools with stateful capabilities swarm

### Minute 6

[06:02] maintains statelessness between
[06:04] interactions focusing on handoffs and
[06:07] routines overall open AI swarm serves as
[06:11] a learning tool for developers to grasp
[06:13] the essentials of multi-agent systems
[06:16] without the overhead of more complex
[06:18] production focused
[06:22] platforms a to go ahead and delete the
[06:25] open AI swarm overview file Force delete
[06:28] and then after that go ahead and clear
[06:30] our active memory go ahead and reset our
[06:33] active memory uh Force
[06:36] [Music]
[06:39] delete the open AI swarm overview file
[06:42] has been deleted and the active memory
[06:45] has been reset if you need further
[06:47] assistance feel free to let me know

### Minute 7

[07:04] you to go ahead and scrape to a file
[07:07] from my
[07:10] [Music]
[07:13] clipboard the content has been scraped
[07:15] from your clipboard and save to the file
[07:17] openai API pricing guide. MD in the
[07:21] scratch
[07:23] Pad wonderful can you go ahead and
[07:25] update that document and just simplify
[07:28] it a lot um I just want a clear
[07:30] breakdown of pricing just single headers
[07:34] and then the pricing of every single
[07:36] model right below that super blunt
[07:38] simple bullet points break down the
[07:40] pricing for me go ahead and use a
[07:41] state-ofthe-art model for
[07:46] [Music]
[07:56] this let's update the open AI API
[07:59] pricing guide markdown file and uh at

### Minute 8

[08:03] the top of the file can you go ahead and
[08:05] add a CSV table with the model name the
[08:11] input pricing and then the output
[08:12] pricing and then can you also just add a
[08:15] um estimated average token pricing as a
[08:19] uh final column go ahead and use the
[08:21] state-of-the-art model for this
[08:24] [Music]
[08:43] hey to go ahead and create a new empty
[08:45] CSV file call it model
[08:50] [Music]
[08:52] pricing the empty CSV file named model
[08:56] pricing. ccsv has been created wonderful

### Minute 9

[09:00] Ada can you go ahead and update the
[09:01] model pricing file I've updated it with
[09:03] model prices just go ahead and get rid
[09:05] of the quotes for us and make sure that
[09:08] it's all snake case for our column
[09:13] [Music]
[09:22] headers nice Joba thank
[09:26] you you're welcome Dan if you need
[09:29] anything else just let me
[09:36] know all right so I hope you can kind of
[09:39] see where things are going with the
[09:41] power of AI assistance when it comes
[09:44] down to it AI assistance are going to
[09:46] accelerate our information rate what
[09:48] does that mean exactly I think at its
[09:50] very core software engineering is about
[09:52] processing and manipulating information
[09:55] and then Building Systems that allow us
[09:58] to do it at scale the combination of

### Minute 10

[10:00] these incredible reasoning models with
[10:02] the new real-time API that gives us
[10:05] speech to speech capabilities is insane
[10:08] for engineering we were able to work
[10:10] through three use cases for personal AI
[10:14] assistance for software engineering in
[10:15] particular and I think that there are
[10:17] plenty plenty more we use about a
[10:19] quarter or a half of our tool set here
[10:22] and uh you know we were able to do a
[10:24] decent amount of work without uh typing
[10:26] a single character so I think that's
[10:28] really important I think this is really
[10:29] powerful and there's an interesting
[10:31] pattern for building AI assistance that
[10:33] I want to share with you here you saw me
[10:35] pull in data into active memory this is
[10:39] basically a simple Json file that
[10:41] probably should be built out into a full
[10:43] database but the idea here is simple as
[10:46] you're working with your AI assistant do
[10:47] you want content to be loaded directly
[10:50] into active memory so that we can use it
[10:53] throughout other prompts just real quick
[10:55] to dip in the code a little bit you can
[10:57] see here that we are constantly loading

### Minute 11

[11:00] in the
[11:02] memory content for instance in our
[11:05] create file call when we're actually
[11:07] generating new files we're going to load
[11:10] the existing memory content from our
[11:12] active memory. Json file into an XML
[11:15] block right so this gets fully loaded
[11:18] into the prompt when we're creating
[11:20] brand new files so this is an
[11:21] interesting pattern that I think is
[11:22] going to be important on top of
[11:25] personalization where we'll be able to
[11:27] customize our personal AI assistance I
[11:29] think this pattern of having an active
[11:31] memory kind of like a ram Random Access
[11:33] Memory I think this pattern is going to
[11:35] be really important moving forward and
[11:37] over time we're going to want our
[11:38] personal AI assistant to automatically
[11:40] manage their own memory as the
[11:43] conversation is going on right and this
[11:44] is all on top of the um historical
[11:47] memory that is built up on top of the
[11:50] real-time API content right and that's
[11:53] probably a good next step to take for
[11:55] the personal AI assistant is to onload
[11:58] so for instance in the the main file

### Minute 12

[12:00] here when we first load our assistant
[12:03] we're going to want to be able to right
[12:05] away load our active memory into our
[12:09] assistant immediately I think this is a
[12:11] massively important Trend to pay
[12:13] attention to as software Engineers this
[12:15] code base is going to be in the
[12:16] description for you if you want to check
[12:18] out this next version of the realtime AI
[12:20] assistant I feel like I'm probably 10
[12:22] tools away from having a really complete
[12:25] Ultra useful software engineering
[12:27] focused AI assistant that I can use in
[12:30] parallel that can work in parallel with
[12:33] me while I'm building out software and
[12:35] getting things done I can feel this
[12:37] tooling I can feel the culmination of
[12:39] all these incredible AI tools changing
[12:41] the way I build changing the way I think
[12:44] about building this is all really
[12:45] incredible technology I hope you can see
[12:47] where this is going we're speaking in
[12:48] natural language to direct and control
[12:51] our personal AI assistant that can
[12:53] delegate work to a slew of specialized
[12:56] AI agents we scraped content we brand
[12:59] code we generated a demo we generated a

### Minute 13

[13:01] proof of concept we discussed a
[13:03] repository and then we did some content
[13:05] reformatting to be totally clear a lot
[13:07] of the stuff you can do by hand on your
[13:10] own I think that's really really clear
[13:12] we're Engineers we can move really
[13:13] quickly on the keyboard but the
[13:16] advantage here I think of having a
[13:18] personal AI assistant with a focus in
[13:20] engineering is to run tasks in parallel
[13:24] to you and get work done in parallel to
[13:27] you by just running a couple commands
[13:28] and by firing off a few Tools in natural
[13:30] language we can have a personal AI
[13:32] assistant get work done with us in
[13:35] parallel I think when you combine that
[13:37] with the powerful reasoning agents we
[13:39] can really set up high quality long
[13:42] running agentic workflows that again are
[13:45] working in parallel with us as we move
[13:48] forward with our day-to-day tasks the
[13:50] future is here it's just not equally
[13:53] distributed yet and to be fair the
[13:55] tooling is still getting there but we
[13:58] get to see it first together here on the

### Minute 14

[14:00] channel by building it stay focused and
[14:03] keep building I'll see you in the next
[14:05] one
